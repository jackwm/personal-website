<h2>Experience</h2>
<dl>

<dt>2014 –&nbsp;present, Lecturer and Tutor, University of Sydney</dt>
<dd>Since 2014, I have been employed by The University of Sydney as a mathematics tutor. During this time, I have had the opportunity to learn from and partner with a diverse student cohort. This diversity includes a range of disciplinary backgrounds and mathematical knowledge, varying age groups, as well as culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. Tutoring has both grown my own knowledge as well as my communication skills, especially in the area of conveying complex subjects in accessible ways. As a tutor, I received excellent feedback from my students specifically regarding my approachability and ability to explain material. I have taught a variety of subjects including Vector Calculus, Differential Equations, Linear Algebra, Integral Calculus, Statistics and Mathematical Modelling.
